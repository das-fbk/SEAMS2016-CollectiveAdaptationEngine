# Abstract
UAV-based systems are both mission-critical and safety- critical since UAVs collaborate with humans and other devices to accomplish defined missions. UAV-based systems are composed of a team of drones, various devices (like movable cameras, sensors), and human agents. Environments in which UAV-based systems operate are often unpredictable and unknown; in other words a model of the environment containing for instance obstacles, no fly zones, wind and weather conditions might be available, however, we cannot assume that such model will be always both correct and complete.

In this paper, we describe a novel approach for managing the run-time adaptation of UAV-based systems. Our approach is based on a generic collective adaptation engine, which addresses collective adaptation problems in a decentralized fashion, operates at run-time, and enables the addition of new entities at any time. Moreover, our approach provides a way to dynamically understand which parts of the system should be selected to solve an adaptation issue. The approach has been empirically evaluated in the context of a private company surveillance scenario.
